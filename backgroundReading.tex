\section*{Stemming and Lemmatization}
\emph{Stemming}
Stemming is the process of cutting words down by removing common appendages to words, such as removing the 's' from 'cars' to make the words 'cars' and 'car the same. This has many advantages in terms of comparison of explicit content such as removing 'ing' from f**king leaving the word f**k allowing for easier comparison. Their are however some major disadvantages which cause issues in the exploration of sexually explicit language. A good example of this is the word 'f**k' simples rules such as this do cause issues as replacing 'ing' with 'in' although mean the same would not compare in a similar manner. Similarly removing characters from the word itself also causes issues e.g. 'f*k' & 'f**k' read the same to any reader however when compared lexographically are different words.

\emph{Lemmatization}
Lemmatiazation similar to stemming handles simple word manipulation such as the coversion from singular to plural verbs, however has the added bonus of thesaurus operators such as having 'hot' match 'warm. This aids us extraordinarily well in the search for explicit material as it allows us to match common spelling or gramatical mistakes with the word it is appropriatley related to.
