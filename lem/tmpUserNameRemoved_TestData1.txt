The visible portion of the human genitals for males consists of scrotum and a penis, for females it consists of the labia, clitoris and vagina. Women have two genital orifices, the vagina and urethra, while men have only one, the urethra. Both male and female genitals have many nerve endings, resulting in pleasurable and highly sensitive touch. 
In most civilized human societies, particularly in conservative ones, genitals are considered a public indecency and sometimes even illegal if left uncovered in public.
